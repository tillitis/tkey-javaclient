# Tkey-jClient
Currently a messsy and somewhat buggy code repo which allows one to send apps, and recieve info, to/from a Tillitis TKey. In effect, this is a Java version of the tkey-client library. 
Serial USB communication is achieved through the use of the external library jSerialComm: https://github.com/Fazecast/jSerialComm.

TODO: 
a. Code Cleanup. Particularly in regards to duplicate code. 
b. Implement a couple more methods which are present in the original tkey-client library.
c. Fix bugs which result in errors, even if apps are loaded in correctly.
d. Implement UDI get method(s).
