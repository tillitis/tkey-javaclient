# Tkey-jClient
This is currently a somewhat messsy code repo which allows one to send apps, and recieve info, to/from a [Tillitis TKey](tillitis.se). In effect, this is a Java version of the [tkey-client Golang package](https://github.com/tillitis/tkeyclient).

## Usage
There are two ways to send apps and communicate with a TKey using this library/project:

### 1: As a stand-alone program

1. Build the TKey device app, [see here for more information](https://github.com/tillitis/tillitis-key1-apps). Note: Official documention does not currently exist for building device apps on Windows. Use WSL.
2. Place the .bin file in the root of this program's directory (not required, but makes life easier).
3. Specify the filepath as the input in the method call loadAppFromFile in main().
4. Connect a TKey.
5. Run the program.

Note: If you simply wish to get the TKey name or UDI, call getNameVersion() and/or getUDI() respectively, and comment out the method for app loading.

### 2. As a library
1. Clone this library and run the command ```.\gradlew build``` to build the jar file. Copy it from tkeyclient\build\libs to root of GUI program.
2. Start the GUI and load apps/get TKey information through it.

## Good To Know
- Due to Gradle lacking support for JDK20, JDK19 (or lower, 17 has been tested) must be used.
  
## To Do

a. Continuous code cleanup. Particularly in regards to unnecessary code. 

b. Improve error handling.
